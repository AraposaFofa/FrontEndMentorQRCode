## My process

first started using the resources to make a good structure. Then I started styling colors and positions, put things on the center and so on.
Then I made a media queria to adjust the page on mobile.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

Did not know that I could change image border lol.
